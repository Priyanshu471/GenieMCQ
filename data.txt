When the Janata government of 1977-79 (including the former Jan Sangh) was elected, it blocked the Towards Freedom Project of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) claiming that the history textbooks promoted by the ICHR suffered an ahistorical Marxist ideological distortion. After the Indian History Congress endorsed the textbook writers affiliated with the ICHR, the Janata government funded the then new Indian History and Culture Society. According to scholars L.I. Rudolph and Sussane Rudolph, it attracted a variety of historians, some sympathetic to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and others disaffected from the textbook "establishment."[2]
